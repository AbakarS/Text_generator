## Text generator

In this work, we will build a deep learning model to generate text. To do this, we carried out the following points:

1. Import the dataset into a Shakespeare text
2. Vectorization of the text
3. Creating number sequences based on sentences
4. Creating batches of sequences
5. Creating the model
6. Train the model
7. Generate an example of the text with the final trained model.
